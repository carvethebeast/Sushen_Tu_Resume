###Step 2: Essays
1. Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.

*As a recruiting coordinator for Amazon Web Services, I work with the hiring team to evaluate candidate competencies and company fit. The more exposure I had to job descriptions for software engineers, the more I thought, “I am perfect for this role!”. I attended coding workshops hosted by local boot camps, set up info interviews with engineers, and spent hours on weekend nights building a cat app on Freecodecamp. When I realized how much I enjoyed it, I knew I need to make coding the next step in my career. 

*Programming requires using trial and error to discover new methods of obtaining a solution. I enjoy the tinkering involved with this method of problem solving. I also like programming because the scope of learning is vast. I will always have a new realm of study that will challenge and excite me. Most importantly, I am excited by programming because there seems to be an unlimited number of things I can do with it: anything I can imagine to be automated or delegated to a machine can be done with coding. It is bewildering to examine the insurmountable growth humans achieved with coding. If modern programming has only existed for the last 60 years, imagine what can be done in our lifetime and beyond. I want to join the revolution of programmers at the forefront of human innovation. More specifically, I wish to improve quality of care, patient experience, and introduce new methods for preventive health using big data.

2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?

*Although I am not sure which programming expertise I wish to be involved in yet, I envision contributing to the growth of technology in healthcare. I believe bioinformatics and programming can significantly improve healthcare accessibility and education, particularly in rural areas where resources are scarce. I am also interested in learning ways computational biochemistry can automate data collection using computer simulations to model lab experiments thereby improving the efficiency of research.   

*Optimal communication during the referral process is a critical component of quality patient care, as it avoids prolonged diagnoses and repeated testing - both at the expense of the patient - stacking unnecessary medical bills and exposure to radiology. Although convincing hospitals to adopt a universal software will be expectedly challenging, an implementation of a secured cloud database where electronic health records (EHR) shared between physicians can help save lives just by improving information transfer. The EHR software that exists for this purpose aren’t adopted universally; I suspect usability and interoperability standards play a limiting factor. This may be easier said than done, but I predict the industry needs a software that is like “the Iphone of EHR software”. We need an EHR software with a simple interface that is user friendly and applicable amongst all healthcare settings. There also needs significant emphasis to market it to hospital shareholders because it takes lots of money to convert systems. With the knowledge I gain from Ada’s course, I hope to modernize the healthcare industry through technological innovation. 

3. Read Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

*Note: I use womxn to show solidarity with the trans community with a means to promote intersectionality. 

*I am a bisexual womxn of color and I strongly identify as an intersectional feminist. I can confidently state this claim because I had a queer role model who fearlessly advocated for racial and gender equity in the Seattle community. Cheryl Chow, who doubled as my basketball coach and drill team mentor, taught me that womxnhood is intrinsic to the self and not defined by social constructs. I learned to recognize ways gender conforming notions about womxn, such as stereotypes depicting outspokenness and dominance as "unfeminine", negatively stunted my personal growth. In college, I learned that systems of oppression are widespread amongst other underrepresented groups as well. For marginalized communities, representation is critical in the development of identity, especially for womxn of immigrant and refugee communities, where their cultures typically devalue gay and womxn rights. I am in a privileged position; I can voice concerns about unfair gender wages and sexual assault where womxn in other nations would be severely punished. It is evident the field of technology will continue to significantly influence the course of civilization. To reduce institutionalized oppression within tech, we should put our best efforts forward to promote diversity and inclusion. I envision tackling gender barriers in tech and act as a role model for the generation of women and gender diverse individuals that will follow.


4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?

*When I was six, my cousin Pearl and I were late to catch our bus afterschool. We sprinted through the courtyard: jackets flying, backpacks awry. We nearly made it until I tripped and fell on cement. As I cried hysterically, Pearl rushed to my side, fed me words of encouragement all the way to the nurse’s office where eventually the magic of a bandage healed my tears. A couple weeks later we are late once again, dashing through the courtyard like aspiring Olympians. Pearl takes the fall and scrapes her hands and knees. I was afraid I would get in trouble for being late, so instead of staying to help, I let her walk to the nurse’s office alone. 

*At the time, I knew I should have walked her back, but I cowered behind my fear of being in trouble. Although the concept of fear and virtue ethics were too complex for me to comprehend at six years old, the guilt embedded in my childhood conscious into adulthood made me realize the following: 1. I have a fear of failure. 2. Fear can be disabling, but not impossible to overcome. 3. Fighting for what I believe in without regard to superficial judgment is a life worth living. We only learn from our mistakes by accepting them as wrongdoings and practice ways to prevent them in the future. I learned self-actualization is attained by recognizing my flaws, accepting them as intrinsic to me, and superseding it to act sincerely.
